title: About
---

I'm a software engineer in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Passionate about space exploration, sustainable energy, and building full stack web applications.  

I focus on writing clean and modular code, always ensuring my applications are as extensible as possible and easy for new developers to get familiar with.  I like thinking about application architecture, and documenting application structure and explicit API interfaces.

Avid hiker, climber, and movie watcher.

Hoping to hop on the Mars Colonial Transporter in < 20 years.
